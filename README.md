<h1>Capturing and Storing Azure Logs in a Secure Storage Account</h1>


<h2>Project Description</h2>
This project demonstrates how to collect, centralize, and securely store Azure activity and resource logs in a dedicated storage account. It ensures that operational and security events are preserved for compliance, auditing, and incident investigation purposes.

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

- <b>Enabled diagnostic settings in Azure to export logs from selected services.</b>

- <b>Configured Azure Monitor to stream logs into a Storage Account.</b>

- <b>Implemented storage lifecycle management policies for cost optimization.</b>

- <b>Applied role-based access control (RBAC) to secure log access.</b>

- <b>Verified log integrity and tested retrieval for investigation scenarios.</b>


<h2>What You Will Learn</h2>

- <b>How to configure Azure diagnostic settings for different resources.</b>

- <b>Integration of Azure Monitor with storage solutions.</b>

- <b>Applying security best practices for log storage.</b>

- <b>Setting up lifecycle rules for long-term log retention./b>
  
- <b>Testing log retrieval for audits and incident response.</b>


<h2>Why This Project Matters</h2>

<b>Logs are critical in cybersecurity and compliance. Centralizing and securing them ensures you can detect, investigate, and respond to threats effectively. This skill demonstrates to employers your ability to implement logging architectures that support both security operations and regulatory requirements.</b>


<h2>Practical Knowledge Youâ€™ll Gain:</h2>

- <b>Azure Monitor and diagnostic settings configuration.</b>

- <b>Storage Account security and encryption settings.</b>

- <b>Retention and lifecycle management strategies.</b>

- <b>Incident investigation workflows using archived logs.</b>

- <b>Compliance-aligned logging practices (ISO 27001, SOC 2, etc.)</b>
